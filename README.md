# Automatization-of-Angle-Resolved-Transmission-and-Reflection-Setup
This software is designed to integrate the following applications: NKT Control, Thor Labs Kinesis, and Thor Labs Optical Power Monitor. This was designed to achieve an automatization of an angle-resolved transmission and reflection setup, created using parts from ThorLabs. The setup aims to determine the power of the transmission and reflection of a single laser based on wavelength and angle of incidence, as well as to determine the power of the maxima and minima of the interference patterns caused by diffraction. Using this setup, a wide variety of wavelengths and angles can be tested with minimal input for the user, allowing for the mass collection of data.
